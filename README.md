# README
For this application you will need rails version 5.2 or better.  The lower the version the more chance there is for errors.  In this app we are using bootstrap and minimagick gems but these should be already in the gemfile for you.

This web application is about dogs and parks around Austin. It has seeded parks data but it does not have seeded users or dogs.  Whoever is running this app will have to create users and add their own dogs.

To get this app running all you need to do is set up the database and run the server. To set up the database run rails db:migrate and then rails db:seed.  This should successfully set up your database with all the parks and be ready for you to create users and dogs.

To start the server you need to run rails s.  Then you will need to go to whichever localhost site you are running this server on. The default is localhost:3000. Now you are ready to traverse the site.
